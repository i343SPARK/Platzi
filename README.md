## Overview

Welcome to my repository, where I share all the courses I've taken at [Platzi](https://platzi.com). Here, you'll find resources, projects, and exercises I've developed while advancing on my learning path in full-stack and video game development, with a special focus on visual creativity.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several main branches, reflecting the diverse range of courses and projects:

- **Master Branch**: Contains all my certificates that I was earning through Platzi.
- **Data-Bases Branch**: Includes data bases technologies such as MongoDB, MySQL(Comming Soon), and among others.
- **Astro Branch**: A section dedicated to Astro principles, and UX/UI design, using technologies like Tailwind for creating engaging visuals.
- **Unity Branch (Comming Soon)**: Showcases projects built with Unity, focusing on both 2D and 3D game development.

## Repository Map

- [Master Branch](https://github.com/i343SPARK/Platzi/tree/master) - The central hub of my learning achievements, holding all the certificates earned.
- [Data-Bases Branch](https://github.com/i343SPARK/Platzi/tree/data-bases) - A deep dive into database management and development with MongoDB and more.
- [Astro Branch](https://github.com/i343SPARK/Platzi/tree/astro) - Focused on modern web development practices and design principles, showcasing projects that blend functionality with aesthetics.
- [Unity Branch (Coming Soon)](https://github.com/i343SPARK/Platzi/tree/unity) - (Upcoming) Will feature my exploration into game development, with projects ranging from simple 2D puzzles to complex 3D environments.


## Important Considerations

- My goal is to become a full-stack and video game developer, with a strong emphasis on visual creativity.
- You might also notice that I have other kinds of learning projects; this is because I'm curious about those topics
- You might find some disorder in this repository, but I am actively working on organizing it and improving its accessibility.
